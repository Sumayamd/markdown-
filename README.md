## data divided into two types

### qualitative
Quality is a measure of excellence or of a state of being. 
It describes something, either of how it was made, or how it is as compared to others.

-Willingness to learn
True professionals are always open to learning more and advancing their skill set. 
You can do this through continued education or self-learning. Rather than waiting for your manager to train you, 
you initiate the learning. A high-quality employee is eager to try new things and even learn from making mistakes along the way.

### quantitative
Quantity, on the other hand, is the extent, size, or sum of something. 
It is countable or measurable and can be expressed as a numerical value.
-Pyhsical quantity 
A physical quantity is a physical property of a material or system that 
can be quantified by measurement. A physical quantity can be expressed as a value,
which is the algebraic multiplication of a ' Numerical value ' and a ' Unit '. For example, 
the physical quantity of mass can be quantified as '32.3 kg ', where '32.3' is the numerical value and 'kg' is the Unit.
